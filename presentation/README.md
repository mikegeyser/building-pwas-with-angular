# Progressive Web Apps - What are they and why should you care?

The hype is real. 

When the excitement about a technology reaches fever-pitch, it becomes difficult to separate the signal from the noise. In the case of Progressive Web Apps (PWAs), it's become very difficult to pin down exactly what they are. Are they indeed the 'next big thing'™ or are they just another fashion trend. Will life carry on if you let the PWA train pass you by, or should you be paying attention?

This talk will explain what PWAs are, and what they are not. It will detail the design patterns, technologies and philosophies that they are composed of. Finally, it will look at real world usage trends, for both web and mobile, and attempt to answer the burning question: should you care about PWAs?	

# Bio

Mike Geyser is a Google Developer Expert in Web Technologies, working in the R&D team at BBD. He is a co-organiser of the Jozi.JS and Docker Johannesburg meetup groups, and is a frequent technical speaker. He has been hacking on the web since GeoCities was a 'thing', and has the keening wail of dialup modem etched into his subconscious. While he is fluent in several ‘golden hammer’ programming languages, he has a long-lived love affair with JavaScript, and cannot see its (many, obvious) flaws. He has worked on lots of interesting enterprise applications, but it is the challenges of the public web that really appeal to him - having spent his formative years building transactional websites. He is always eager to talk about the web platform, but be warned, he is prone to hyperbole.
